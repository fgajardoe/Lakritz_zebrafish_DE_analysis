# Differential expression analysis in atoh7 -/- _Zebrafish_ mutant.

This directory contains data and scripts used in the differential expression analysis between WT zebrafish and atoh7 -/- mutant.

## Relevant files

+ `differential-expression-analysis/004_original_marray_annotated_sample_log2.csv` contains normalised _log2_ intensities used for DE analysis.
+ `differential-expression-analysis/Original_Marray_list.xls` contains an Excel table with normalised _log2_ intensities including probe annotations.
+ `probe-gene-assignment/significant.annotated.tsv` contains the final version of the table (in tab-separated format) with DE probes, including Gene names and Ensembl gene IDs.
+ `probe-gene-assignment/Full-Table.xlsx` contains the same data than `significant.annotated.tsv` but in Excel format.
